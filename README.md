# Sort Timing

Recently, we have been discussing many different sorting algorithms. Why do we need to think about this?
The short answer is that each sorting algorithm has a different _run time_. In this project, you will
assess the runtime of each sorting algorithm using Big-O notation.

## Timing Sorts

Please time each of the following sorts:
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
